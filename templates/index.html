<p>jStem is a niche and simplistic (after understanding JSON) tool that allows for minor song tweaking and stem playing using JSON syntax. This allows you to set the speed, skip to your favorite parts, and mute certain parts of your songs.</p>
<p>jStem currently supports SoundCloud as a source for songs, with more sources to come in the future.</p>
